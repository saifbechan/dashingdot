 - you are a game developer, making a cool web based game. You are going to use the best coding standards for web based games in phaser
 - all the source files for the UI are in the folder raw-assets
 - this folder we don't commit to github, we just use them locally
 - we need to take the assets from the raw folder, edit them, and move them to public folder
 - make sure the folder structure of the public folder makes sense
 - usually there are multiple files in the raw assets folder, we need to combine them into a sprite and use them that way
 - please use the best tool possible to create the sprites - you are allowed to use javascript but if you prefer a better tool go for it
 - if you create any temporary files please clean them when you are done
 - we don't need to process the raw assets on every run, only when it is needed
